If you're dealing with long text in the terminal and want to clear or remove it quickly without having to use backspace repeatedly, there are a few useful shortcuts and methods you can use:

1. Clear Entire Line (Ctrl + U)
If you paste something long by mistake, use Ctrl + U to clear the entire line at once.
2. Delete Word by Word (Ctrl + W)
If you want to delete text word by word (instead of character by character), use Ctrl + W.
3. Move Cursor to Start of Line (Ctrl + A)
Press Ctrl + A to move the cursor to the beginning of the line. You can then use Ctrl + K (see below) to delete the rest of the line.
4. Delete from Cursor to End of Line (Ctrl + K)
If youâ€™ve positioned the cursor partway through a long line of text, Ctrl + K will delete everything from the cursor to the end of the line.
5. Clear Terminal (Cmd + K)
If you want to clear the entire terminal screen, use Cmd + K. This will clear the current terminal output, but note that it won't remove the current input line.
6. Clear Entire Screen (clear)
You can also just type clear to clear the terminal screen completely.
