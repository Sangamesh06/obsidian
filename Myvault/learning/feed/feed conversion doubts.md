    When managing product variants, grouping parameters play a crucial role in organizing and displaying related products. Here's an explanation of the provided parameters:

### Grouping Parameters

1. **group_id:**
    
    - **Parameter:** `group_id`
    - **Value:** `productId`
    - **Description:** This field is used to group products with similar identifiers into a single entity. In this case, `productId` is the field on which products are grouped to create variants. This means that all products with the same `productId` are considered variants of the same base product.
2. **group_variants:**
    
    - **Parameter:** `group_variants`
    - **Value:** `size,color,imageUrl`
    - **Description:** These are the fields that are used to display the different attributes of the variant products when grouping is done. When products are grouped based on `productId`, the variations in `size`, `color`, and `imageUrl` are shown to distinguish between different variants.

### Detailed Explanation

#### group_id: `productId`

The `group_id` parameter is essential for identifying which products should be grouped together as variants. By setting `productId` as the `group_id`, all products with the same `productId` are considered part of the same group. This is useful for organizing products that come in different sizes, colors, or other attributes.

For example, if you have a product, "T-shirt," that comes in different sizes and colors, each variant of the T-shirt will have the same `productId` but different values for size and color.

#### group_variants: `size,color,imageUrl`

The `group_variants` parameter specifies which attributes to display for each variant within a group. By listing `size`, `color`, and `imageUrl`, you are telling the system to show these fields as distinguishing features for each variant of the grouped product.

- **size:** The size of the product variant (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
- **color:** The color of the product variant (e.g., Red, Blue, Green).
- **imageUrl:** The image URL representing the product variant visually.
