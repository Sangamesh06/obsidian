Argo Workflows is a Kubernetes-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs. In the Argo dashboard, the interface allows you to interact with your workflows through various actions and links. Here's an explanation of the keywords you mentioned, along with a brief overview of submitting a workflow template to Argo.

### 1. **Resubmit**

- **Explanation**: The "Resubmit" button or option allows you to re-run a workflow that has already been executed. This is useful if you want to repeat a workflow with the same parameters or if the previous run failed, and you want to try again without creating a new workflow from scratch.

### 2. **Delete**

- **Explanation**: The "Delete" option allows you to remove a workflow from the Argo system. This is particularly useful when you want to clean up old or failed workflows to keep your dashboard and Kubernetes cluster organized. Deleting a workflow removes all associated resources.

### 3. **Logs**

- **Explanation**: The "Logs" link or button provides access to the logs generated by the workflowâ€™s individual steps. This is crucial for debugging and understanding what happened during the workflow execution. The logs can be viewed for each step, making it easier to identify issues or confirm successful completion.

### 4. **Workflow Link**

- **Explanation**: The "Workflow Link" usually points to the URL where you can view the detailed execution of the workflow in the Argo dashboard. It provides an overview of the workflow's DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and its current status, such as pending, running, succeeded, or failed.

### 5. **Resume**

- **Explanation**: The "Resume" button or option is used to restart a paused workflow. Workflows may pause due to manual intervention or because they reached a step that requires input. The "Resume" function allows the workflow to continue from where it was paused.
